This was a semestral project for the "realistic graphics class."

Users can setup a .JSON config file, where they configure a scene in 3d space,
that the program then can render.

The scene itself consists of a single Camera object, LightSource objects and Solid objects put into a hierarchy tree.
Camera objects in the config file are defined by their origin, direction, rotation, width and height
